My name is Abhishek Chakravarti. I live and work in Kolkata, India. I enjoy
programming, and it grew out of a hobby in my school days to a full-fledged
profession. 

I have had a somewhat eccentric career, and have often found myself drawn into
into administrative roles that I did not enjoy. Rather late in life, I have
understood that I am happiest while tinkering with source code while working in
the GNU/Linux ecosystem.
