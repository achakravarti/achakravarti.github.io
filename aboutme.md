My name is Abhishek Chakravarti. I live and work in Kolkata, India. I enjoy
programming, and it grew out of a hobby in my school days to a full-fledged
profession. 

I have had a somewhat eccentric career, and have often found myself drawn into
into administrative roles that I did not enjoy. Rather late in life, I have
understood that I am happiest while tinkering with source code while working in
the GNU/Linux ecosystem.

Since Feb 24, 2020, just for fun, I have been using WakaTime to track the
metrics related to my coding activities. Here are the figures:

As you can see, I tend to spend most of my time inside GNU/Linux and Vim! :-) I
am happy to have come out of the Windows ecosystem that I was tied down to in my
earlier professional incarnation.
