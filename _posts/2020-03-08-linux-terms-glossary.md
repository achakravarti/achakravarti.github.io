data into, and displaying or printing data from, a computing system. Terminals
were historically used for allowing inexpensive mutli-user access to expensive
computing systems.


## terminal emulator
A *terminal emulator* is a program running on a personal computer that emulates
a traditional *terminal*, providing the *shell* to access the OS running on the
computer. Terminal emulators can run both within and without GUIs. Several
terminal emulator instances can run concurrently.


## terminal window
A *terminal emulator* running within a GUI. Examples are **xterm**, **urxvt**,
and **GNOME Terminal**.


## terminal, virtual
A *virtual terminal* (or *virtual console*) is a *terminal emulator* running
outside a GUI. Linux systems generally provide six virtual consoles that can be
cycled through by pressing the `ALT-F1` to `ALT-F6` keys.
