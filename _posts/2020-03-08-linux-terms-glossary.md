# S


## shell
The *shell* is the command line interpreter program that provides the command
line interface between human users and Unix-like systems.


# T


## terminal
A *terminal* is an electronic or electro-mechanical device used for entering
data into, and displaying or printing data from, a computing system. Terminals
were historically used for allowing inexpensive mutli-user access to expensive
computing systems.


## terminal emulator
A *terminal emulator* is a program running on a personal computer that emulates
a traditional *terminal*, providing the *shell* to access the OS running on the
computer. Terminal emulators can run both within and without GUIs. Several
terminal emulator instances can run concurrently.


## terminal window
A *terminal emulator* running within a GUI. Examples are **xterm**, **urxvt**,
and **GNOME Terminal**.


# V


## virtual console
A *virtual console* (or *virtual terminal*) is a *terminal emulator* running
outside a GUI. Linux systems generally provide six virtual consoles that can be
cycled through by pressing the `ALT-F1` to `ALT-F6` keys.
